Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This benchmark evaluates three-process finite state machine (FSM) coding styles in FPGAs, separating state storage, next-state transition logic, and output decoding into distinct blocks.
It implements a structured controller to test synthesis optimization and register mapping across decoupled FSM architectures.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Expect to consume combinational LUTs for next-state and output combinational blocks along with state register flip-flops.
It analyzes how synthesis tools optimize multi-process state machine descriptions and combinatorial boundary paths.
